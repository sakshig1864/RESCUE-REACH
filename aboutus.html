     <h1>About Rescue Reach</h1>

  <p>
    Rescue Reach is a community-focused emergency assistance platform
    developed to support individuals living with Alzheimer’s and
    Parkinson’s disease.
  </p>

  <p>
    Patients affected by these conditions may experience memory loss,
    confusion, disorientation, or difficulty communicating during
    emergencies. In such situations, identifying the individual and
    contacting their caregivers quickly becomes critical.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our platform provides a secure QR-based identification system.
    When scanned, it instantly displays essential details such as
    emergency contacts, medical conditions, and caregiver information —
    helping responders act without delay.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>
    To ensure that no individual suffering from cognitive or motor
    disorders is left helpless during emergencies.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Vision</h2>
  <p>
    To build a safer and more compassionate society where technology
    bridges the gap between vulnerability and immediate support.
